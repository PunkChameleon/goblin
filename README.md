-Node.js
-Node Package Manager (npm)
-CouchDB

Then, here are the steps:

1. Download goblin and place it in a directory
2. Create a database in CouchDB. Write down the name, url, port and credientials.
3. Take this information, and place it in the appropriate fields in 'db.js'.
4. Change the default username and password in 'goblin.js' (by default, it is gb-admin and admin, respectively).
5. Navigate to the directory in the command line, and run the 'goblin.js' file with node. ('nodejs goblin.js' in linux, 'node goblin.js' in OS X/Unix).
6. Go to 'localhost:8000/' in your browser, and 'localhost:8000/gb-admin', and you'll see goblin run!

you run into (no matter how small) and submit improvements if you can!
