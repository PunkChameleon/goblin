**What is goblin?**

Goblin in a Javascript-based Content Management System, built on Node.js and utilizing CouchDB as it's data store.
It's focus is to be as easily templateable as possible, so that front-end developers can just hop in and do what
they do best.

It's a great, and very versitile language. It's also the language of the web, and is one that front-end dev's are more
comfortable with.

**Why is Goblin so great?**

It just is!
