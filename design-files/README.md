###Info About Design Files

These files are made and designed as Adobe Fireworks pngs, contributed by davemullen.

##What we are looking for on a dev side

We are hoping to have these files boostrapped and intregrated. If you are familiar with Backbone, or another notable client-side MV* format, feel free to utilize.

As of now, the files are just plain HTML, with plain JS sheets that are using ICanHaz for tempaltes (ICanHazJS.com). The pages are minimal and the intregration should be relatively painless.

##If you feel like tackling, please do! And let us know!

We'd love your awesome front-end help! Every user of goblin will see and interact with this page, so it's absolutely central to the product and we need to make sure it's done to the best of it's ability :)
