### Code Style Guidelines

Here are the basic style guides for all JS committed to the project. This will be evolving as new problems
are encountered, with both additions and subtractions. Before you submit a pull request, please make sure your
code meets these guidelines (and please feel free to raise new points and objections!):

1. All code must pass through 'grunt test' before being committed.
2. Use JSFormat to properly space your code (or follow what has already been done)
3. Utilize camelCase (see what I did there?)
4. Tabs are 4 spaces.
5. Test! Test! Test! Test! Test! (That's five times! The best number of times to test!)
