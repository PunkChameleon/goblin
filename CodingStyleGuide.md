### Code Style Guidelines

Here are the basic style guides for all JS committed to the project. Before you commit, please make sure your code meets these guidelines:

(And please feel free to raise new points and objections)

1. ASI is used (due to the diligent efforts of the brilliant @sotiri) -- only used semicolons when actually needed.
2. Tabs are 4 spaces.
3. Spaces come after the variable declarations.
4. Utilize camelCase (see what I did there?)
