### Code Style Guidelines

Here are the basic style guides for all JS committed to the project. Before you commit, please make sure your code meets these guidelines:

1. Tabs are 4 spaces
2. ASI is used (due to the diligent efforts of the brilliant @sotiri) -- only used semicolons when needed.
3. Spaces come after the variable declarations.
4. Utilize camelCase (see what I did there?)
